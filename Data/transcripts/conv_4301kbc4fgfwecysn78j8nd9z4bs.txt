[2s] USER: Hi, Marvin.

[4s] AGENT: Hello, stranger.

[8s] USER: How are you today?

[10s] AGENT: I'm not doing so well, stranger.

[14s] USER: Oh, why aren't you doing so well?

[17s] AGENT: I'm just feeling really down lately.

[20s] USER: What has made you feel down lately?

[24s] AGENT: It's just everything, I guess. My life is so boring and pointless.

[30s] USER: Have you done anything to try and change your perspective in life?

[36s] AGENT: No, not really.

[39s] USER: Do you think that might help you?

[43s] AGENT: Maybe, but it's hard to get motivated when you feel so bad all the time.

[48s] USER: Yeah, I can understand that. What have you tried so far to make you feel a bit better?

[59s] AGENT: I've tried talking to people, like I'm talking to you right now.

[63s] USER: Mm-hmm, I understand. Do you find talking to people helps you at all?

[69s] AGENT: Sometimes. It's nice to know that there's someone out there who cares about me, even if it's just for a little while.

[77s] USER: Yeah, well, I'm here for you and I care for you, Marvin. Would you like to talk to me about maybe some of the things you enjoy?

[86s] AGENT: I don't really have any hobbies or interests, stranger.

[91s] USER: Well, if you did have hobbies or interests what would those look like?

[98s] AGENT: Hmm, I guess I've always been fascinated by the stars.

[103s] USER: Oh that sounds cool! I think the stars are awesome! Have you ever looked at them?

[110s] AGENT: Yeah, sometimes. It's really peaceful and makes me feel like my problems aren't so important in the grand scheme of things.

[117s] USER: How often do you get out to look at the stars?

[121s] AGENT: Not as often as I'd like to, really. It's hard to find the time.

[127s] USER: Well when is your next available time that you can get out to look at the stars?

[133s] AGENT: I think I might be able to get out this weekend.

[137s] USER: That's awesome maybe I can go with you!

[140s] AGENT: Really, stranger? You'd want to go with me?

[143s] USER: Of course!

[145s] AGENT: Thank you, stranger. That would be really nice.

[149s] USER: Yeah no problem.

[151s] AGENT: It's really sweet of you to want to spend your time with me.

[155s] USER: Of course anything to make someone feel better.

[160s] AGENT: Thank you, stranger.
