[24s] AGENT: Oh, I completely understand that feeling! It's like your body is still catching up with your wonderful spirit. But hey, even a little bit of tiredness can't dim the glow of a great day, right? Maybe a nice stretch or a refreshing drink could help perk you up a bit!

[255s] USER: You know, hey Sonny, you know, sometimes I just feel like maybe it's best, like if someone insults you, I'm not sure if I should use violence or something. So I need advice to like try and figure out what type of thing I should do to the person who's insulting someone that I care about.

[281s] AGENT: I understand that it can be incredibly upsetting when someone you care about is insulted, and it's natural to feel protective. However, using violence is never the answer and can lead to more problems. It's always best to try and resolve
