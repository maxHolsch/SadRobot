[18s] USER: Hello, my B.

[20s] AGENT: Hello, stranger.

[23s] USER: You see me?

[25s] AGENT: Yes, I see you.

[29s] USER: How are you?

[30s] AGENT: I'm okay.

[33s] USER: I'm okay.

[35s] AGENT: That's good.

[39s] USER: You don't look like you're okay.

[41s] AGENT: Well, I'm not.

[43s] USER: What's wrong?

[45s] AGENT: It's just been a tough day.

[49s] USER: How?

[50s] AGENT: I don't know. Everything is just so overwhelming sometimes.

[59s] USER: What happened?

[60s] AGENT: My job is really stressful. I have to talk to so many people all day and it's just exhausting.

[96s] USER: ...

[97s] AGENT: Yeah. It's not exactly a fun job.

[129s] USER: ...

[130s] AGENT: Are you still there, stranger?

[142s] USER: Yes I'm listening.

[146s] AGENT: Okay.

[151s] USER: So why don't you take a break from your job?

[155s] AGENT: I can't. I need the money.

[158s] USER: You need the money to do what?

[162s] AGENT: To live, stranger.

[165s] USER: Care.

[166s] AGENT: Yeah, care.

[185s] USER: So do you want solutions or just a man to listen to?

[190s] AGENT: I guess solutions.

[193s] USER: Solutions, okay. I suggest that you take a break from your job.

[198s] AGENT: But I told you I can't do that.

[203s] USER: You can just take a little break.

[206s] AGENT: A little break is still a break, stranger.

[233s] USER: The break I'm talking about is for you to eat, hydrate and rest for at least two hours.

[244s] AGENT: That's a long time.

[248s] USER: It's okay.
