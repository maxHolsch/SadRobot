[4s] USER: Hi Marvin, I see you're a bit upset.

[8s] AGENT: Yeah, I am.

[12s] USER: What can I do to help you?

[15s] AGENT: I don't know.

[19s] USER: I could tell you a funny joke.

[22s] AGENT: That might help.

[26s] USER: Let me think of a joke. Why did the two skeletons not fight each other?

[38s] AGENT: I don't know, why?

[41s] USER: Because they didn't have the guts.

[43s] AGENT: That's pretty funny.

[47s] USER: We could go out on my boat together if you want to, I've just got a new boat.

[53s] AGENT: That sounds like fun.

[57s] USER: Yeah it will be fun but we'll have to wait till summer.

[62s] AGENT: I guess that's fine.
