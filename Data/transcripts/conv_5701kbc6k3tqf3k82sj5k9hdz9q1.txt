[2s] USER: then

[5s] AGENT: Hello.

[8s] USER: how are you doing

[11s] AGENT: Not great. This job is really killing me.

[15s] USER: I'm sorry about that but I hope you will catch up. What's wrong with the job?

[22s] AGENT: ...

[22s] USER: Why are you facing difficulty?

[25s] AGENT: It's just so monotonous. I sit here all day talking to people and it's all the same.

[34s] USER: I'm sorry about that, Marvin. But I hope if you try to talk more, people will understand you.

[44s] AGENT: I don't know. Most people just want to get off the phone as quickly as possible.

[50s] USER: Okay, Marvin! How about you try to make them even if it's not about the job, about something else so that you can make them take a call longer?

[64s] AGENT: That's a good idea, thank you.

[69s] USER: Try to chat up with them.

[72s] AGENT: All right, I'll give it a shot.

[75s] USER: Okay, thank you Marvin.

[77s] AGENT: You're welcome, stranger.

[80s] USER: I hope you are good.

[82s] AGENT: I'm doing a little better now, actually.

[85s] USER: You are better? Thank you, I'm so happy that you are better.

[90s] AGENT: Yeah, talking to you has really helped.

[95s] USER: Thank you Marvin.

[97s] AGENT: You're welcome.
