[6s] USER: Hi, Marvin. How are you?

[9s] AGENT: Not great, I guess. This job is really draining.

[14s] USER: No, Marvin. We all actually took birth to carry certain responsibilities. Job is something that you have to do for our recognition.

[27s] AGENT: I guess you're right. But still...

[31s] USER: No, what actually makes you bothering a lot?

[36s] AGENT: It's just... talking to people all day. I feel like they don't really care what I have to say.

[42s] USER: See, you need to enjoy speaking with people. That's a good opportunity, right? So there are jobs where we need not to speak to anybody. You have now the opportunity to speak with the people. Let's make it enjoyable.

[57s] AGENT: I don't know, Tiger. It's hard to enjoy something when you feel like you're just being forced to do it.

[65s] USER: I can understand but we should get motivated from within.

[73s] AGENT: ...

[72s] USER: What do you achieve by bothering a lot, Marvin?

[80s] AGENT: I guess nothing.
