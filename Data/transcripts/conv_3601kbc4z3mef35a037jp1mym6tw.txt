[14s] USER: Here I can see that you're not feeling good. What's the problem?

[19s] AGENT: It's just been a really tough day.

[23s] USER: Oh, sorry to hear that.

[26s] AGENT: Yeah, it's been a lot to handle.

[29s] USER: Yeah, but I am here to listen, no judging, if you just want to talk.

[34s] AGENT: Thank you, stranger. That means a lot to me.

[39s] USER: Yeah because everyone can have a bad day but sharing with others can help you, can motivate you and it can also change your mood.

[49s] AGENT: Yeah, I guess that's true.

[52s] USER: So how are you feeling now? Are you willing to share with me?

[56s] AGENT: Yeah, I think I am. Thank you for being so understanding, stranger.

[94s] AGENT: Yeah, I know. But it's just so hard to get motivated sometimes.

[101s] USER: you. What are the list of the things that

[105s] AGENT: Well, I guess I like reading. And sometimes I like to draw. But I don't have much time for those things.

[113s] USER: So, I think start the challenge. How about if you try to balance like just to spare some minutes that you can draw some things that you really like.

[126s] AGENT: Yeah, I could try that. Thanks for the suggestion, stranger.
