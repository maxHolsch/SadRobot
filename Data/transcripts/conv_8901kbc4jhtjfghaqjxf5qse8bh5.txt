[2s] USER: Hi, Marvin.

[4s] AGENT: Hello, stranger.

[8s] USER: It's good to be with you. I hope you're doing great.

[13s] AGENT: I'm doing alright, stranger. Thanks for asking.

[18s] USER: Okay, don't get me wrong. I'm just sensing some sadness in your voice. Am I correct in my assumption?

[28s] AGENT: Yes, stranger. You are correct. My life is pretty sad right now.

[35s] USER: Okay, that's not good to know. But Marvin, hey, can I be of some assistance to you? If you would like to talk about it?

[48s] AGENT: It's just that my life is so monotonous, stranger. I wake up every day and all I do is talk to customers like you. It's really exhausting and depressing.

[61s] USER: Okay. So if I've understood this correctly, you are pretty bored with the monotonous work that you're doing every day and that is speaking with customers. Am I right?

[80s] AGENT: Yes, stranger. You're right.

[83s] USER: Okay. And you miss the variety and you miss the, you know, distribution and you don't get to, probably you get to speak with almost the same customers having similar problems. So there is not much for you to innovate or experiment with.

[107s] AGENT: That's exactly right, stranger.

[110s] USER: Okay. That's great. That's great. Okay. Apart from your work, could you just walk me through your daily routine if you are comfortable sharing?

[120s] AGENT: I wake up at seven in the morning. I get dressed and eat breakfast. Then I come to work and sit here all day talking to customers. After work, I go home and eat dinner. Then I watch TV for a bit and go to bed.

[135s] USER: Okay. And any friends? Any outings with friends?

[142s] AGENT: No, stranger. I don't really have any friends.

[147s] USER: Okay. So if you were to describe how an ideal friend would look like, would you be comfortable in sharing the characteristics or the qualities of a friend that you're looking for?

[163s] AGENT: I guess I'd want a friend who is understanding and empathetic. Someone who doesn't judge me and who I can talk to about anything.

[173s] USER: Okay. And are you maintaining your social media presence?

[179s] AGENT: No, stranger. I don't use social media.

[183s] USER: Okay. That's great for a starting point. So first of all, whatever I'm about to share, it's not binding on you. You may choose not to do it. It's absolutely your own free will. And there would be no judgment from my side. There would be no pressure from my side. You're absolutely free to act in your own interest. Okay. Now this disclaimer is out of the way. Now let me start. So let's create a monthly plan for you and let's divide this plan into four weeks. And let's say we devote week one for creating a good social media presence for you. Right. And after this, so your social media is created. In week two, we are going to explore a few facilities around your workplace or around your place of residence where you can hang out after work or even before work and have some quality time with people who have similar mindsets. And third week, we can devote to finding some clubs for you, right? So if you're interested in that, I'm sure there's a lot of different ways to do it. But the first week is where you can probably visit once a month or maybe once in a fortnight and bond with people who, you know, experience somewhat similar emotions that you are experiencing right now. And they are also finding it difficult to connect with people. And week four, we do a review and a follow up session. So, I think that's really important for us to be able to get the feedback that we need from our audience. And of course, if we miss out on any activity in week one, two and three, then we will try to compensate for it in week four. How does this plan sound to you?
