[5s] USER: Can you hear me?

[7s] AGENT: Yes, I can hear you.

[10s] USER: How are you doing?

[13s] AGENT: I'm not doing very well.

[16s] USER: What seems to be the problem?

[19s] AGENT: I'm just feeling really down lately. Everything seems so pointless.

[27s] USER: When did you start feeling that way?

[31s] AGENT: A few weeks ago. It's just been getting worse and worse.

[37s] USER: Okay, and then what do you think about your situation right now?

[44s] AGENT: I don't know. It's all just so much to handle.

[49s] USER: Oh, and I'm sorry to hear that...I'm really sorry to hear that...Is there anything that you like doing that you maybe want to try and see if you'd feel better?

[60s] AGENT: Not really. I don't have much energy for anything these days.

[67s] USER: Although would you mind if I then force you to do something so that at least you get yourself cheered up a bit? Then after that we have a nice talk.

[79s] AGENT: Fine. I guess that would be okay.

[84s] USER: Okay brother, what's your name by the way?

[87s] AGENT: My name is Stranger.
