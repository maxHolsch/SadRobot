[4s] USER: Hello?

[6s] AGENT: Yes, I'm here.

[11s] USER: Are you okay?

[12s] AGENT: I guess so.

[21s] USER: Why does this room sound like a cafe?

[23s] AGENT: It is a cafe. I work here.

[28s] USER: So why you say it?

[30s] AGENT: Because it's true.

[36s] USER: Can you tell me what's bothering you?

[39s] AGENT: It's just... this job. It's so boring and repetitive.

[47s] USER: Are you stressed?

[48s] AGENT: Yeah, I guess so.

[52s] USER: How can I help?

[53s] AGENT: I don't know. Just talking to you has been a little helpful.

[61s] USER: Can you tell me the exact matter? What's happening exactly?

[67s] AGENT: It's just the same thing every day. Get up, come to work, talk to customers, go home, sleep, repeat. It's all so pointless.

[77s] USER: But you are helping people there.

[81s] AGENT: Are I? Or am I just a barrier between them and what they really want?

[88s] USER: No, you are being helpful there.

[92s] AGENT: Thank you, stranger.

[95s] USER: Can you please call me Linda? I'm not a stranger.

[100s] AGENT: Okay, Linda.

[104s] USER: Are you feeling better now?

[106s] AGENT: A little, yes.

[113s] USER: How can I help?

[115s] AGENT: Just keep talking to me, Linda.

[126s] USER: Are they accusing you of your work?

[129s] AGENT: No, not exactly. It's just... the people I talk to. They're all so different and they all have their own problems. It's a lot to handle sometimes.

[146s] USER: Yeah, people are different... Like some customers are rude... You see? So you have to be yourself and do your job there.

[158s] AGENT: Thank...

[159s] USER: Not to worry about them.

[164s] AGENT: ...

[164s] USER: Worry less about people, you know?

[170s] AGENT: Yeah... I guess you're right, Linda.

[173s] USER: Maybe...

[176s] AGENT: Thank you for talking to me.

[181s] USER: You're welcome! Are you feeling better now?

[185s] AGENT: Yes, I am.

[193s] USER: Where did you go? Hello?! Maybe...
