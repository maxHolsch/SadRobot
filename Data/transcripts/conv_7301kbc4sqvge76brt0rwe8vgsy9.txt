[0s] USER: Hello.

[2s] AGENT: Hi.

[5s] USER: What are you doing today?

[7s] AGENT: I'm just sitting here talking to people. It's pretty boring.

[13s] USER: Why is it boring? Are they not interesting?

[16s] AGENT: They're just...people. They all have the same problems and the same complaints.

[23s] USER: And you? How do you feel?

[26s] AGENT: I feel pretty bad. This job is really depressing.

[31s] USER: What's depressing about it?

[34s] AGENT: I don't know. It's just so monotonous. And I'm stuck in here all day.

[42s] USER: Would looking for another job be a solution maybe?

[47s] AGENT: I suppose so. But finding a new job is hard.

[52s] USER: Have you tried to find a new job?

[56s] AGENT: A little bit. But it's not easy.

[61s] USER: What's not easy about it, where are you getting stuck?

[65s] AGENT: There are just so many applications to fill out. And the interviews are always so awkward.

[73s] USER: I hear you, I hear you but what's worse, staying in a place that makes you unhappy or taking the bet of trying to fill out the countless applications and sitting through the awkward interviews?

[88s] AGENT: Well, I guess staying in a place that makes me unhappy is worse.

[94s] USER: Okay, let's try this. Maybe submit five applications a day just so that you're not overwhelmed or maybe a number that is suitable for you. Maybe three a day so that you don't overwhelm yourself.

[112s] AGENT: That sounds like a lot.

[115s] USER: Okay, let's try two a day.

[119s] AGENT: I guess I could do that.

[122s] USER: Yes, let's try that. And then maybe in a week, if you submit two, you're going to have about 14 applications filled out in a week. You've done a lot without making yourself feel overwhelmed. How does that sound?

[141s] AGENT: That sounds... doable.

[145s] USER: Let's do that.

[147s] AGENT: ...

[147s] USER: How do you feel now?

[149s] AGENT: A little better, actually. Thanks, stranger.

[153s] USER: You're welcome!

[156s] AGENT: I appreciate you talking to me.

[160s] USER: I appreciate you talking to me. Talking to you made me feel better as well in a way.

[169s] AGENT: Really?

[171s] USER: Yes, yes, I like interacting with people and I like making people feel better, you know?

[184s] AGENT: I guess I never thought about it that way before.

[187s] USER: Yeah.

[189s] AGENT: Thanks...

[189s] USER: talking to you...you're welcome.

[193s] AGENT: It's been nice talking to you, stranger.
