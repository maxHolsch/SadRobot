 ""Yes, actually, I do have some questions. I was wondering if you could tell me more about accreditation and why it's important?""
 'Absolutely! Accreditation is important because it ensures that the counseling program meets certain standards set by the profession. This means that the program has been reviewed and approved by other professionals in the field. It also means that the program will likely provide you with a good education and prepare you well for your career as a counselor.'

 ""Yeah, I have. But it feels like they just brush me off and say they're too busy. I know they care about me, but it's hard when I feel like I'm always last on their list.""
 ""Gina, it sounds like you're feeling really hurt and alone right now. Have you considered taking a break from your relationship? Just for a little while so that you can focus on yourself and your own needs?""
 ""Yeah, that's actually something we've been talking about lately. I think some time apart might be good for us right now.""
 'That sounds like a good idea, Gina. Taking some time apart can be really helpful in giving both of you some space to figure out what you want and need from the relationship. If you decide to come back together after some time apart, counseling can still be beneficial in helping you learn how to communicate more effectively so that you can avoid conflict in the future.']","['Gina' 'Counselor' 'Gina' 'Counselor' 'Gina' 'Counselor' 'Gina'
