What do you think would work for you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I guess first of all, I need to be more aware of when I'm getting angry so that I can try to stop myself before it gets too bad. Secondly, once I am aware that I'm getting angry, I need to take some deep breaths and try to calm myself down before doing or saying anything rash. And finally, even after I've calmed down, if the thing that made me angry is still bothering me, then maybe talking about it calmly with the person who upset me or with somebody else who was involved in the situation could help diffuse the anger even further."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\"Those are all great suggestions!
