What do you mean?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, something to make you feel better or take your mind off of things for a while.

Have you talked to them about how their fighting is affecting you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I haven't because I'm afraid of what they might say or do if I bring it up. Plus, they always seem so wrapped up in their own problems that they don't even notice how much their fighting affects me."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, maybe we can brainstorm a way for you to bring it up with them without them getting too upset? What do you think?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that could work.

Do you play online with other people or just by yourself?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sometimes I'll play with my friends online, but mostly I just play by myself.

They keep giving me more and more work to do and it's just too much."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, maybe you could try talking to them again or looking for a new job. Sometimes change can be really good for us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's true. I've been thinking about looking for a new job actually.

It's just been a really tough day. First, I overslept and had to rush to get ready for school. Then my math teacher gave us this huge test that I didn't study for at all. And on top of that, my best friend got mad at me for something stupid and she won't talk to me now."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, no! That does sound like a pretty terrible day.
